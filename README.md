# checkers
Pretty simple, original checkers project. 
I wrote in my first year at university.
Very mediocre artificial intelligence, but implemented using interesting methods. 
A lot of classes, for ease of understanding, since other people helped me to do part of the project (design, part of the UI).
If you have any questions about the project, you can always pm me.
